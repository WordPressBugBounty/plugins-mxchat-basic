For DeepSeek, visit platform.deepseek.com. For OpenRouter (100+ models), visit openrouter.ai. Each provider offers different pricing tiers and free credits for new users.

= Can I train the AI chatbot on my website content? =

Yes. MxChat supports unlimited knowledge base training using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. Import content from WordPress pages, posts, WooCommerce products, custom post types, PDFs, Word documents, text files, sitemaps, and manual Q&A entries. The AI chatbot will use your content to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses.

= What is RAG technology and how does it work? =

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI technique that retrieves relevant information from your knowledge base before generating responses. When a visitor asks a question, MxChat searches your trained content using vector embeddings, finds the most relevant matches, and provides that context to the AI model. This ensures accurate, factual answers based on your actual website content rather than generic AI responses.

= Does MxChat work with WooCommerce? =

Yes. MxChat includes full WooCommerce integration. The AI chatbot can be trained on your product catalog including titles, descriptions, pricing, SKUs, categories, and custom fields. Enable auto-sync to automatically update the knowledge base when products change. Your chatbot can answer questions about products, pricing, availability, and help customers find what they need.

= Can I customize the AI chatbot appearance? =

Yes. MxChat offers extensive customization options including custom colors, chatbot icon, AI avatar, chat bubble size, light/dark/system themes, positioning (left/right), custom CSS, greeting messages, placeholder text, and widget layouts. Use the built-in AI Theme Generator to describe your ideal design and let AI create custom styling automatically.

= How do I add the chatbot to my WordPress site? =

You can add the chatbot using the shortcode `[mxchat_chatbot floating="yes"]` for a floating widget or `[mxchat_chatbot floating="no"]` for an embedded chat. Alternatively, enable "Append to Body" in settings to automatically display the chatbot on all pages without shortcodes.

= Does MxChat support streaming responses? =

Yes. MxChat supports real-time streaming responses for OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and xAI Grok models. Streaming displays AI responses word-by-word as they're generated, providing a faster, more engaging chat experience for your visitors.

= What is the Chat Transcripts feature? =

The Chat Transcripts dashboard provides comprehensive conversation management. View all chat histories, see detailed conversation flows, track which knowledge sources the AI used for each response, monitor user engagement, and analyze chat analytics including daily activity, peak hours, and user distribution.

= Can I see which content the AI chatbot used to answer questions? =

Yes. MxChat includes full knowledge source transparency. In the Chat Transcripts and the optional debug panel, you can see exactly which pages, posts, products, or Q&A entries the AI retrieved and used to generate each response, along with relevance scores.

= Is Pinecone vector database required? =

No. MxChat includes free, unlimited local vector storage in your WordPress database. Pinecone integration is optional and recommended only for enterprise-scale knowledge bases with thousands of entries requiring faster search performance.

= Does MxChat support multiple languages? =

Yes. The AI chatbot supports multi-language conversations and automatically responds in the language your visitors use. MxChat also supports right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic and Hebrew.

= How much do AI API calls cost? =

API costs depend on your chosen provider and model. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others charge based on token usage. DeepSeek and Google Gemini offer generous free tiers. MxChat includes intelligent token optimization to minimize API costs. You can also set rate limits for guests and logged-in users to control usage.

= Is MxChat GDPR compliant? =

Yes. All conversation data is stored locally on your WordPress site, giving you complete control. Configure automatic data retention policies, export chat transcripts, or delete conversations as needed for compliance.

= Can I restrict chatbot access to certain users? =

Yes. MxChat includes role-based access controls. Restrict the chatbot to logged-in users only, specific user roles, or keep it public. You can also restrict specific knowledge base content to certain user roles.

= Does MxChat support live chat handoff? =

Yes. MxChat integrates with Slack for live agent handoff. When the AI cannot help or a visitor requests human support, conversations can be seamlessly transferred to your team via Slack.

= What are Actions and how do they work? =

Actions are custom triggers that execute when user intent is detected. Create actions for lead capture, appointment booking, support tickets, page redirects, or custom JavaScript. The AI automatically recognizes when users want to perform these actions and triggers them contextually.

= Can visitors upload documents to chat? =

Yes. Enable document uploads to let visitors chat with PDFs and Word documents. The AI extracts and processes document content in real-time, allowing contextual Q&A about uploaded files.

= Does MxChat support image generation? =

Yes. With DALL-E integration, the AI chatbot can generate images based on user descriptions directly within the chat conversation.

= How does the knowledge base auto-sync work? =

Enable auto-sync for posts, pages, WooCommerce products, or custom post types. When you publish or update content, MxChat automatically updates the knowledge base with the new information. No manual re-importing required.

= Can I use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) with MxChat? =

Yes. MxChat fully supports Advanced Custom Fields. ACF field data is automatically included when importing content. Use the ACF Field Settings to control which custom fields are included or excluded from the knowledge base—perfect for hiding private notes or internal data from the chatbot.

= What embedding models does MxChat support? =

MxChat supports multiple embedding models for vector search including OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002, text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, Google Gemini embedding, and Voyage AI embeddings. Choose the model that best fits your accuracy and cost requirements.
